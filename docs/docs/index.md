!!! quote "On the Craft of Software Engineering"

    In the era of generative AI, it's easy to assume that software engineering is becoming obsolete—after all, code can now be produced on demand. But this view misunderstands what engineering has always been.

    Software engineering was never just about typing code. It is about framing problems correctly, making disciplined architectural decisions, weighing trade-offs, and building systems that can grow without becoming fragile. AI-assisted code generation is a powerful multiplier, yet it amplifies the engineer's judgment rather than replacing it.

    This shift is simply the next step in a long evolution of tools—from assembly to higher-level languages, from IDE refactoring to intelligent assistants. Each advance removed friction, but none removed the need for clear thinking.

    A generated function has little value unless we understand what to build, where it belongs, how it fits existing patterns, and why it is better than the alternatives. Those questions define real engineering.

    The best engineers have always been those who think clearly, communicate crisply, and design deliberately. Today's tools allow us to focus more on those essentials—and less on syntax.
