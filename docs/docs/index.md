!!! quote "On the Craft of Software Engineering"

    *"In the era of generative AI, when coding assistants can produce code on demand, many assume that software engineering is nearing its end. But this fundamentally misunderstands what engineering is."*

    **Software engineering was never just about typing code** — it's about framing problems well, making disciplined architectural choices, weighing trade-offs, and building systems that can evolve without fragility. AI-assisted code generation is a powerful multiplier, but it magnifies the engineer's judgment rather than replacing it.

    This is the natural evolution of our tools: from assembly to higher-level languages, from snippets and IDE refactors to today’s assistants. Each step removed friction, but none removed the need for clear thinking.

    A generated function means little unless we know *what* to build, *where* it belongs, *how* it aligns with existing patterns, and *why* it outperforms the alternatives. Those are the questions that define engineering.

    The strongest engineers have always been those who think clearly, communicate crisply, and design deliberately. Today's tools simply shift more of our attention to those essentials — and away from syntax.
